## Introduction
We performed a large-scale user study to collect a wide spectrum of signals about user behaviors on smartphones, including touch, gesture, and pausality of the user, as well as movement and orientation of the phone. This dataset has been used to evaluate a continuous authentication modality named H-MOG in smartphones.

A data collection tool for Android phones was developed to record real-time touch, sensor and key press data invoked by user's interaction with the phone. Data from three usage scenarios on smartphones were recorded: (1) document reading; (2) text production; (3) navigation on a map to locate a destination.

100 volunteers were recruited for a large-scale data collection. When a volunteer logs into the data collection tool, the volunteer is randomly assigned a reading, writing, or map navigation session. For each session, the volunteer either sits or walks to finish the tasks. One session lasts about 5 to 15 minutes, and each volunteer is expected to perform 24 sessions (8 reading sessions, 8 writing sessions, and 8 map navigation sessions). In total, each volunteer in our experiments contributed about 2 to 6 hours of behavior traits. The data have been completely anonymized.
